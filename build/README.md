# Build Info

The final build files are inside the js folder, these include the BBElements.js library as well as all it's dependencies ( located inside the BBElementsFiles folder ). Both the library and it's dependencies folder must be located inside a js/ folder at the root level of the html file ( in this case example.html ) making use of the library.
